ScoreBoardle is a score-sharing app for Wordle and the basic multiword variants:

- Wordle (1)
- Dordle (2)
- Quordle (4)
- Octordle (8)
- Sedecordle (16)
- Duotrigordle (32)

By playing any of these web-based games (in daily mode) within the app, the results can be combined and shared as one image/post. You also have the ability to pick which game results to share. It should be noted the app doesn't change gameplay in any way. Perpetual data (streaks/statistics/etc.) are saved just as they would be if played in a typical web browser.

A big thanks to the Wordle team/community and all the variant authors!

Usage:
Simply choose the game you wish to play and your results will be automatically saved. When you click the edit button in the upper right (from main screen or within any game), you will be taken to the score screen. Here you can click each game to enable/disable their inclusion. Finally, click the share button in the upper right when ready.
